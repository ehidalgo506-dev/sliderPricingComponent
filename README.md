### What I learned

To be honest, I didn't know how to use, create or implement a slider before so this for me was a challege and I did have to do my research on the internet. For me it was a pretty awesome project to learn about this.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

### Continued development

This was an awesome opportunity to learn about the slider but it opened my eyes that there are a lot of components that I haven't used before. This project inspired me on continue working on these kind of projects to learn more.
